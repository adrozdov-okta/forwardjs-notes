## In person code review is...

Faster
but
Weird Tension or Awkwardness

## Instead of Being Right

- Style Guides (Javascript, CSS)
- Linters
- Complexity (CodeClimate, Sonar)
- Test Coverage (Blanket.js)

* avoid generalizations
	* "Can you show me what you mean?"
* avoid labeling (correcting misconceptions), and personal comments
	* "What changes can I make so that this code is more idiomatic?"
	* "How can we make this better?"

> The reviewer wants to guide the author like it is a Socratic discussion (feels like school)
	> Creates a guessing game for the author (or a Gulf)
	> "I'm confused about what that means, where should we start?"
> Destress
	> "Let's pick this up again tomorrow."
