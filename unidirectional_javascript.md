# Unidirectional Javascript (with #mercury)
#### Jake Verbaten @raynos

- Tried elm, amazing but in haskell
- Nested unidirectional app
  - cursor/lens (look up). Takes big state, add some key path, embed a substate

- The interesting bit is unidirectional + **immutable**
- Allows you to reason about source of truth
- Can we do this with our stuff?
- Diff with react - more strict about immutability
